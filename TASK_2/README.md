I hope you're all doing well. An analysis I conducted on unemployment data in India, focused on the impact of the COVID lockdown on employment. Using Python libraries Seaborn and Plotly, I explored estimated employment, unemployment rate (%), and labour participation rate (%). Let's dive in! 📊

After importing Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly, I loaded the unemployment dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easy exploration and manipulation. Employing Seaborn, I created a line plot that showcased the estimated employment and unemployment rates over time. The x-axis represented the time period (e.g., months or years), while the y-axis displayed the rates as percentages. Customizing the plot's aesthetics ensured a clear understanding and visual appeal.

Utilizing the same dataset, I extracted the labour participation rate data and employed similar data manipulation and visualization steps. With Seaborn, I crafted a bar plot illustrating the labour participation rate trends. The x-axis denoted the time period, and the y-axis represented the rate as a percentage. Plotly's interactive features enhanced the plot, enabling users to obtain detailed information by hovering over the bars.

🔍 𝐂𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐃 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:

1. Steep decline in estimated employment rates during the lockdown period due to business closures and economic slowdown.
2. Significant rise in the unemployment rate, reflecting the challenges faced by job seekers during this challenging period.
3. Adverse effect on the labour participation rate as individuals faced difficulties in finding employment opportunities.

🌐 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:
Using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Plotly, I effectively analyzed and visualized unemployment data, focusing on estimated employment, unemployment rates (%), and labour participation rate trends. By exploring the impact of the COVID lockdown on jobs in India, we can gain valuable insights into the challenges faced by the workforce.
